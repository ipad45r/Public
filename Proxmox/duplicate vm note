when duplicating vm, it might produce same ip (conflict)

run this in the vm

echo -n >/etc/machine-id
rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
ln -s /etc/machine-id /var/lib/dbus/machine-id

This worked for me too. Using Ubuntu 24.04.
In fact I only did
> dbus-uuidgen > /etc/machine-id

3. Solving Ubuntu/Linux Specifics (Machine-ID)
If you are cloning/restoring Ubuntu (22.04+), DHCP may use the machine ID (/etc/machine-id) instead of the MAC address to assign IP addresses, causing clones to take the same IP. 

    Fix: Before shutting down the VM to create the backup, run:
    bash

truncate -s 0 /etc/machine-id
rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
ln -s /etc/machine-id /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
