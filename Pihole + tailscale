when you install pihole systemwide, and tailscale, localhost might encounter internet problem
this is due to system is using magicdns
you need to edit resolv.conf

to edit
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

add second nameserver after tailnet

nameserver 127.0.0.1


to make subnet router work
sudo tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.168.0.0/24,pihole/32 --accept-dns=false --advertise-exit-node
