# Here's a sample Bash script (rclone_copy.sh) that loads the password from password.txt and runs the rclone copy command:

#!/bin/bash

# Load the password from password.txt
PASSWORD=$(< /path/to/password.txt)  # Change this to the path of your password.txt

# Export the password to the environment variable
export RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS="$PASSWORD"

# Define source and destination
SOURCE="/path/to/source/*"  # Change this to your source directory
DESTINATION="remote:destination"  # Change this to your rclone remote destination

# Run rclone copy command
rclone copy "$SOURCE" "$DESTINATION" --log-file="/path/to/rclone.log" --log-level=INFO

# Check for errors
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "An error occurred during the rclone copy operation. Check the log file for details." >> /path/to/rclone.log
else
    echo "Rclone copy completed without errors." >> /path/to/rclone.log
fi



#Password Security: Ensure that the password.txt file is secure and not accessible by unauthorized users. You can set the permissions to restrict access:

#$ chmod 600 /path/to/password.txt
